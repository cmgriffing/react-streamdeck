# Installation

Be warned: You are responsible for setting up the React to vanilla js compile process and outputting that into your property inspector.

There is a CLI tool that can help with scaffolding a React-ified boilerplate:

## Commands

To install run:

```
yarn add react-streamdeck
```

or

```
npm install react-streamdeck
```

## Import SDPI CSS

Currently we rely on a forked version of the sdpi.css example from StreamDeck's plugin documentation. We plan on working on this in the future.

Importing it into your main App.js is currently the best approach. This will work with most Webpack based apps out of the box such as create-react-app.

```
import "react-streamdeck/css/sdpi.css"
```
