# Usage

Using this library will be similar to using any other component library with a couple notable exceptions.


## Components

The components are pure components and will work with most existing React applications. They do not use any hooks on their own.

```javascript
import { SDButton } from 'react-streamdeck';

export default App() {
  return (
    <SDButton
      text="Click Me!!!"
      onClick={(event) => {
        console.log('I was clicked.');
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Hooks

The hooks are a different story. We currently export higher order functions that require dependent hooks to be injected into a factory function. This allows us to not conflict with the existing React hooks versions you may have in your code.

```javascript

import { useState, useEffect } from 'React';
import { createUseSDAction } from 'react-streamdeck';

const useSDAction = createUseSDAction({
  useState,
  useEffect
})

export default App() {

  const connected = useSDAction('connected');

  return (
    <div>
      <pre><code>
        {JSON.stringify(connected)}
      </code></pre>
    </div>
  )
}

```
